      <h3>When I began learning web design a few weeks ago, I had <em>zero</em> experience with coding. I was a little nervous about jumping into the deep end but after <em>many</em> hours of hard work, here are some of the projects I have worked on:</h3>
      <div class="surround">
        <h3 class="bg-success">Hello World</h3>
          <div class="curve">
            <p>This is the very first webpage I made, the bare bones of HTML. These are the concepts practiced here:
            <ul>
              <li>Basic HTML Structure</li>
              <li>Learning about "Tags"</li>
              <li>Proper Spacing</li>
              <li>Creating a Repository</li>
              <li>Curious? Just click <a/ href="https://github.com/MichaelHolland23/hello-world/blob/master/hello-world.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <h3 class="bg-success">Pet Website</h3>
          <div class="curve">
            <p>This webpage taught me how to include more variation into my code. This exercise utilized:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adding images</li>
              <li>Using a wider array of "Tags"</li>
              <li>Inline Elements</li>
              <li>You can see the progress <a href="https://github.com/MichaelHolland23/my-pet/blob/master/my-pet.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <h3 class="bg-success">Dream Vacation</h3>
          <div class="curve">
            <p>This was the first project to make use of the Bootstrap framework. The code here makes use of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Containers</li>
              <li>Columns</li>
              <li>Rows</li>
              <li>Overall styling improvements</li>
              <li>Take a look: <a href="https://github.com/MichaelHolland23/dream-vacation/blob/master/index.html">Dream Vacation</a>.</li>

      <h4>A little more about me ...</h4>
        <p>Portland, Oregon is my adopted home. I moved here from Chicago. The midwest is an idyllic place to grow up, but I wanted to try living in another part of the country for a few years. My advice to anyone thinking about moving to Portland is that you should <em>ABSOLUTELY</em> not do it! It is constantly raining; there are landslides and quakes pretty much all the time; the people here are the coldest, meanest folks you'll ever meet; and good luck finding quality, farm-to-table cuisine made with locally-sourced, fresh ingredients prepared by chefs who devote their lives to making the best possible meals. If that appeals to you, then, by all means ...</p>
        <p>I attended college in Iowa where I earned my bachelor's degree in communications. I worked as a staff writer and business manager for the student newspaper, <em>Insight</em>.</p>
        <p>I love reading, technology, economics, tennis, hiking (duh!), and very specific types of shennanigans. I hope to one day complete the great work.</p>
